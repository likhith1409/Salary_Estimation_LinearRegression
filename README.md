## Introduction

Machine learning is a powerful tool for salary prediction. Whether you're a job seeker, employer, or recruiter, understanding the potential salary for a given job is essential. This project aims to help users estimate salary based on specific features using a Linear Regression model.

## Project Overview

The project has two main components:
1. **Machine Learning Model**: The core of the project is a Linear Regression model trained on a dataset containing relevant features like years of experience, education level, and more. The model is deployed using Streamlit.

2. **Streamlit Web Interface**: A user-friendly web application is created with Streamlit, allowing users to input their own data and get salary predictions instantly.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salary-estimation.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd salary-estimation
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit web application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
2. Open your web browser and go to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501). You'll see the user interface for entering parameters and obtaining salary predictions.
3. Input the relevant job parameters (e.g., years of experience, education level, etc.).
4. Click the "Predict Salary" button to get a salary estimate based on the model's prediction.
